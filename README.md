# arithmetic-encoder (the shitpress project) ![shitpressS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86105423/185766722-3c0016f9-f5e5-4184-94af-0b1ba94bc866.png)

Super small dynamic (no tables encoded) arithmetic compressor in C, no external dependencies.

Not good enough to be usable (slow, not great compression ratio), but it works, its concies and it is theoretically very good. Contains
alredy compiled program and src.
